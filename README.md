# 🏥 Medical Management System — Backend

A full-stack **Medical Management System** backend built with **Node.js, TypeScript, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. It manages patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, billing, pharmacy inventory, and includes a **rule-based AI vitals checker** that flags abnormal patient readings (blood pressure, sugar, temperature, heart rate, pulse rate, RBC, and WBC counts).

> ⚠️ This project is under active development. Some modules may still be incomplete.

## 🏗 Architecture

This backend follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with a 4-layer structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Presentation Layer         │  ← Controllers, Routes, Middlewares
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  Application Layer          │  ← Use cases / Application Services, DTOs
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  Domain Layer                │  ← Entities, Value Objects, Repository Interfaces
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  Infrastructure Layer       │  ← MongoDB Schemas, Repository Implementations, Redis, Email/SMS
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Each business module (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Vitals, Prescription, Billing, Pharmacy, etc.) follows this same layered pattern, keeping business logic independent of frameworks and the database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- A MongoDB Atlas connection string (or local MongoDB)
- A Redis connection (Redis Cloud or local)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAbbas-coder004/Madical-Managment.git
cd Madical-Managment/Backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (see below)
cp .env.example .env

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

If the server starts successfully, you should see:
```
Redis connected successfully
Redis client is ready
MongoDB connected successfully
Server running on port 5000
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev     # Run in development mode (tsx watch)
npm run build   # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start       # Run the compiled production build
```

## 🤖 AI Vitals Checker

The vitals module evaluates each submitted reading against standard medical thresholds and returns a `normal`, `warning`, or `critical` status with flagged parameters.

| Vital | Normal Range |
|---|---|
| Blood Pressure | 90–120 / 60–80 mmHg |
| Sugar Level | 70–140 mg/dL |
| Temperature | 97–99°F |
| Heart Rate | 60–100 bpm |
| Pulse Rate | 60–100 bpm |
| RBC Count | 4.2–5.9 million/µL |
| WBC Count | 4,000–11,000/µL |

**Example request:**
```json
POST /api/vitals
{
  "patientId": "083c21e1-fcbd-45a0-9600-04d73ea92ce2",
  "bloodPressureSystolic": 115,
  "bloodPressureDiastolic": 75,
  "sugarLevel": 90,
  "temperature": 98.4,
  "heartRate": 72,
  "pulseRate": 70,
  "rbcCount": 4.8,
  "wbcCount": 6500
}
```

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Vitals recorded and analyzed successfully",
  "analysis": {
    "status": "normal",
    "flaggedParams": [],
    "message": "All vitals are within normal range."
  }
}
```

If vitals are flagged as `critical`, the system automatically sends an **email alert** and a **real-time Socket.io notification** to the assigned doctor.

> ⚠️ This is a rule-based engine, not a diagnostic AI. It is intended to assist, not replace, professional medical judgment.

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt**
- Sessions are managed with **JWT**
- Logged-out tokens are **blacklisted in Redis** so they can't be reused
- Optional **OTP verification** adds a second authentication factor on login
- **Role-Based Access Control** restricts sensitive routes (e.g., only `admin` can create doctors)
- Request bodies are validated with **Zod** before reaching business logic

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker (Optional)

Docker configuration is included for future deployment but is **not required** for local development (this project currently runs against MongoDB Atlas and Redis Cloud).

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This spins up three services: `backend`, `mongodb`, and `redis`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

API endpoints can be tested with **Postman**:
1. Register a user → `POST /api/auth/register`
2. Login → `POST /api/auth/login`
3. Copy the returned token into an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Test protected routes (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Vitals, etc.)

Basic unit tests (Jest) are set up for core domain logic (e.g., value object validation).
